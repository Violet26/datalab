10.5,Cooperative Extension Service,USDA,Department of Agriculture,"A - FORMULA GRANTS, B - PROJECT GRANTS","GENERAL: [As reflected in Part I,B. of the Request for Applications (RFA) or Capacity Requests for Applications (Capacity RFA)]
1. Smith-Lever (3b) & (c) Capacity Grants (formerly known as Formula Funds)

a) Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions (formerly known as 3b & c Formula Funds) 
These funds are used by institutions eligible to receive funds under the Act of Congress approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, entitled ‘‘An Act donating public lands to the several States and Territories which may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts’’ (Twelfth Statutes at Large, page five hundred and three) (“1862 Land-grant Institutions”), for the development of practical applications of research knowledge and giving of instruction and practical demonstrations of existing or improved practices or technologies in agriculture, uses of solar energy with respect to agriculture, home economics, and rural energy, and subjects relating thereto to persons not attending or resident in 1862 Land-grant Institutions in the several communities, and imparting information on those subjects through demonstrations, publications, and otherwise and for the necessary printing and distribution of information in connection with the subjects.
The purpose of this funding is to conduct agricultural extension work.

(b) Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions (Special Needs) – 
The purpose of this funding is to increase the level of agricultural extension work. These funds are used to support extension activities identified in the eligible institution’s approved 5-Year Plan of Work. Special Needs funds are allocated to a State Cooperative Extension Service to fulfill a purpose or overcome a condition peculiar to the State, as compared to the country as a whole, or for a purpose not normally a part of the continuing extension program.

(c) Smith-Lever Special Needs Program 
Funds support innovative extension education approaches to addressing risks, hazards and disasters. The Cooperative Extension Service (CES) has an important role in reducing the impact of disasters through extension education. The Extension Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to assist in preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from disasters. Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families and individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure, severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or high consequence animal diseases and plant pests.

There has been an increase in public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease, and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response and remediation. 

Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities, and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information, 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals and communities to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During and after these incidents, local Extension agents served as a critical communication node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. 

The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one or more of the following six key target areas: 

1. Education and Technical assistance through inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 

2. Collaboration with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations to support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 

3. Long range family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 

4. Communication delivery of key information that meets end-users’ needs in a timely fashion with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster situations; 

5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 

6. Integrated Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs (e.g., the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative and etc…) and lead nationally important disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. 

Fundable projects should support education and extension activities which: 

1. Reduce risk through planning, disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving communication between the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies; 

2. Develop strategies and educational materials and/or programming in the area of emergency planning, infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 

3. Develop community networks that provide real-time disaster education information; and/or 

4. Develop or expand educational materials regarding disaster issues suitable for use and distribution by the Extension Disaster Education Network (EDEN) or the eXtension Community of Practice working with disaster planning.

97.024,Emergency Food and Shelter National Board Program,DHS,Department of Homeland Security,B - Project Grants,"Program funds support the National Preparedness Goal (NPG) by complementing actions undertaken to achieve an “all-of-Nation preparedness approach that optimizes the use of available resources.” When a disaster strikes, it is often the poor or those with economic vulnerabilities who suffer the most. By providing emergency economic assistance that keeps people off the streets, from being evicted from their homes, or with groceries to prevent hunger, the EFSP prepares a population that could otherwise be even more adversely impacted by a disaster situation and mitigates potential burdens imposed on recovery efforts to assist such people. 

For additional details on the NPG, please refer to http://www.fema.gov/pdf/prepared/npg.pdf.","The law directs that the Local Boards, which manage the program at the local level, shall ""determine which private nonprofit organizations or public organizations of the local government in the individual locality shall receive grants to act as service providers."" The range of participant groups on the Local Boards include the affiliates of the National Board membership which consists of American Red Cross, Catholic Charities USA, The Jewish Federations of North America, National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, The Salvation Army, and United Way Worldwide, with a local government representative replacing FEMA. Also participating are thousands of independent nonprofits (such as Community Action Agencies and Food Banks and food pantries) which provide food and/or shelter services. Due to the broad category of people in need of such emergency services, the providers can include specialized groups such as domestic violence shelters, Native American organizations, and organizations providing food or shelter to: AIDS patients, handicapped individuals, the elderly, homeless veterans, non-wards of the State teenage runaways, and many other groups with emergency food and shelter needs. As noted earlier, the decisions on selections are made through the consensus of the Local Board as they have assessed their community's most urgent needs. It is important that such agencies use these funds to supplement, not replace, their current efforts. This program is intended to supplement ongoing programs and allow them to extend and expand upon their existing services.",State,2,Support Services,http://www.fema.gov,https://cfda.gov/index?s=program&mode=form&tab=step1&id=25e8c0bc8d5b568e2f5f0f3b1cf0aca6
