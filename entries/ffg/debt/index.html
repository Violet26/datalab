    <h1>By the end of 2018, the federal government had $21.5 trillion in federal debt.</h1>

    <div class="debt-copy">
        <p>How did we end up with $21.5 trillion in federal debt? When the U.S. government has a deficit, most of the deficit spending is covered by the government taking on new debt. It is similar to people using their credit card for a purchase rather than cash, check, or a debit card. Over the years, if the federal government experiences more deficits than surpluses, the federal debt grows.</p>
