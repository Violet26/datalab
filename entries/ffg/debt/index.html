title: Data Lab - Explore Federal Debt – U.S. Treasury
excerpt: How did we end up with $21.5 trillion in federal debt? When the U.S. government has a deficit, most of the deficit spending is covered by the government taking on new debt. It is similar to people using their credit card for a purchase rather than cash, check, or a debit card. Over the years, if the federal government experiences more deficits than surpluses, the federal debt grows.

                    <p>The change in federal debt each year is heavily influenced by the deficit or surplus that year. When there is not enough revenue to pay for spending, the government borrows money to make up the difference.  When there is excess revenue in a given year, the majority of those funds are used to pay down the federal debt.</p>

Gross domestic product (GDP) figures come from the {{site.data.object_mapping.bea_gdp.value}}. Throughout this page, we use the gross domestic product for the Fiscal Year, not the Calendar Year, in order to facilitate an appropriate comparison.
