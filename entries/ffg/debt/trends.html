In response to actions taken to address the Great Recession, federal debt increased at a faster rate after 2008. Federal debt rose from $10 trillion in 2008 to $16 trillion in 2012.

Federal debt as a percent of gross domestic product in 2000 was 55%. By 2008, this ratio had reached 68%. From 2008 to 2012 federal debt as a percent of gross domestic product increased to 99% and has remained above 100% since 2016. By the end of 2018 the ratio stood at 104%."/>
