            <p>This chart outlines the total debt of the United States compared to 171 different countries in 2018.  In 2018, the United States' debt totaled $21.5 trillion. That $21.5 trillion in debt was equivalent to 104% of U.S. GDP for 2018.</p>
            <p>How does the United States compare to countries of similar size and GDP? Explore the chart below. You can compare debt (in dollars) and debt as a percent of GDP. Find a country of interest and see for yourself.</p>

        <p>This visualization was created using the {% include ffg/data-sources/country_comparison_mspd.html %} as the data source for federal government debt of the United States. Gross domestic product (GDP) figures come from the {% include ffg/data-sources/imf_gdp.html %}. Debt figures for countries other than the United States also come from the {% include ffg/data-sources/imf_debt.html %}. Since debt figures were provided in the national currency for the selected countries, the numbers were subsequently converted to U.S. dollars. Currency conversion rates were pulled from {% include ffg/data-sources/xe_conversion.html %} for {% include ffg/data-sources/curr_conversion_date.html %}; the last day of the U.S. federal government's fiscal year.</p>
        <p>The conversion of debt figures to U.S. dollars makes comparisons among countries more convenient. However, the implied burden of debt may be misrepresented for a given country if the majority of that nation’s debt was denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, and the currency in which the debt was held had an abnormal valuation relative to the U.S. dollar on the date of currency conversion.</p>
