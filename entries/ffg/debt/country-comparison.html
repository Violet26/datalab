        <p>In researching potential data sources for information on the spending of other governments for the country comparison module, the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2056.html">CIA World Factbook</a> was chosen because it provides the best comparison of federal spending by country for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the volume of countries with 2017 data,</li>
            <li>relative consistency with the level of government measured (central government only as a standard),</li>
            <li>all figures expressed in US dollars</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Countries with figures before 2017 were excluded from the country comparison data set. Although most countries in the data set feature spending from central government sources only, there may be countries with state/provincial/local spending included. As a result, this visualization should not be considered an absolute comparison of the spending of central governments for all countries.</p>
        <p>To finish the data set for Country Comparison, gross domestic product figures from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database were combined with the CIA World Factbook data set, excluding countries that were not available from both sources.</p>
