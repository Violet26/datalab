                        <p>The majority of federal revenue comes from individual and corporate income taxes as well as social insurance taxes. When individuals and corporations earn more money, they pay more in taxes, and thus federal revenue increases. Alternatively, if they make the same amount, but tax rates increase, the federal revenue will also increase. Decreases in federal revenue are largely due to either individuals or corporations making less money or a decrease in tax rates.</p>

                        <p>Government spending can be broken down into two categories: mandatory and discretionary. Mandatory spending is determined by previous law and includes spending for programs like Social Security and Medicare. Discretionary spending is determined by the President and Congress each year in the budget and appropriations process. First, the President puts together a budget proposal and sends it to Congress. Then, the House and Senate both draft budget resolutions. Congress can change funding levels, as well as add or eliminate programs, taxes, and other sources of revenue. Once the budget resolutions have been finalized in the House and Senate, Congress reconciles the differences and votes on a final budget. The discretionary spending levels in the budget are divided among the twelve Appropriations Subcommittees, who then draft bills providing funding levels for the Departments, bureaus and agencies within their jurisdiction. After the House and Senate agree to a final funding level for each bill, they are sent to the President for approval or veto.</p>

                <p class="chapter__paragraph--tightened">To pay for a deficit, the federal government borrows additional funds, which increases the debt. The total debt that the federal government owes is essentially the accumulation of deficits over time, minus debt repaid by any surpluses, plus debt that the Treasury owes to other parts of the federal government. Other activities contribute to the change in federal debt, such as changes in the Treasury's operating cash account and federal student loans.</p>
