            <p>This chart outlines the total revenue of the United States compared to {{site.data.object_mapping.countries_compared.value}} different countries in {{site.data.object_mapping.country_compare_year.value}}. In this section, figures are presented using financial data from {{site.data.object_mapping.country_compare_year.value}}, allowing us to provide you with the most recent revenue data for the greatest number of countries.  In {{site.data.object_mapping.country_compare_year.value}}, the United States collected {{site.data.object_mapping.compare_us_revenue.value}}. The {{site.data.object_mapping.compare_us_revenue.value}} in revenue collected was equivalent to {{site.data.object_mapping.compare_us_revenue_gdp.value}} of total U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) for {{site.data.object_mapping.country_compare_year.value}}.</p>

        <p>The visualization was created using the <a target="blank" href="{{site.data.object_mapping.country_comparison_mts.value}}">Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS)</a> as the data source for federal government revenue of the United States. Gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the United States come from the <a target="blank" href="{{site.data.object_mapping.bea_gdp.value}}">Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)</a>. GDP data for countries other than the United States comes from the <a target="blank" href="{{site.data.object_mapping.imf_gdp.value}}">International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook Database (WEOD)</a>.</p>
        <p>In researching potential data sources for information on the revenue of other governments for the country comparison module, we chose the <a target="blank" href="{{site.data.object_mapping.cia_world_factbook.value}}">CIA World Factbook</a> because it provides the best comparison for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the number of countries with {{site.data.object_mapping.country_compare_year.value}} data,</li>
            <li>relative consistency with the level of government measured (central government only as a standard),</li>
            <li>all figures expressed in US dollars.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Countries with figures before {{site.data.object_mapping.country_compare_year.value}} were excluded from the country comparison data set. Although most countries in the data set feature revenue from central government sources only, some countries included state/provincial/local revenue. As a result, this visualization should not be considered an absolute comparison of the revenue of central governments for all countries.</p>
        <p>To finish the data set for Country Comparison, gross domestic product figures from BEA and the IMF WEOD were combined with revenue figures from the CIA World Factbook data set, excluding countries that did not have data available from both sources.</p>
