        The visualization was created using {{site.data.object_mapping.mts_homepage.value}} as the data source for federal government revenue of the United States. Some categories from the MTS have been renamed in order to be more easily understood. {{site.data.object_mapping.bls_cpiu.value}} was used to adjust revenue in fiscal years {{site.data.object_mapping.inflation_adj_years.value}} for inflation. Adjusting for inflation allows users to see real, not nominal, changes in sources of revenue over time.
